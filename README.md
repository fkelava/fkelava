I'm Fran. The plush unicorn is Peppy.

I spent the past few years working for [AVL in Croatia](https://www.avl.com/en-hr/locations/avl-ast-doo), where my programming knowledge was used for various projects in the automotive sector.

I am currently working on reverse-engineering the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remasters, and developing [Fahrenheit](https://github.com/peppy-enterprises/fahrenheit/), the mod framework for them.
