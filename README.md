I'm Fran. The plush unicorn is Peppy.

I spent the past few years working for [AVL in Croatia](https://www.avl.com/en-hr/locations/avl-ast-doo) on various projects in the automotive sector.

I am currently reverse-engineering the Final Fantasy X/X-2 [HD Remasters](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359870/FINAL_FANTASY_XX2_HD_Remaster/), and developing [Fahrenheit](https://github.com/peppy-enterprises/fahrenheit/), the mod framework for them.
